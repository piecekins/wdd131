			<p>My Smoker Build

			These are the four main parts of my smoker, each one built by hand to make the whole thing work the way I wanted.

			Body
			The body was the first piece you should worry about, makeit a sturdy tank to give plenty of cooking space. I made sure everything was square and solid before moving on.

			Box
			The firebox is where all the heat comes from, so make it out of thick steel and sealed it tight. It’s designed to hold wood or charcoal and keep the temperature steady.

			Chimney
			The chimney directs smoke and controls airflow through the smoker. Make it the highest point so it pulls smoke smoothly and helps maintain an even burn.

			Door
			The door needed to seal well and stay strong under heat, so you should reinforced the edges flat strap and added heavy-duty hinges. It closes tightly to keep smoke inside where it belongs.

			Final Assembly
			Once all the parts were built, once you weld everything together to make one solid smoker. After the final welds, it all comes together into a strong, clean build that’s ready for cooking.
